The Silver Bullet Nano Ceramic Root Volumizer Hair Crimper is the simple way to add height and extra "oomph" to hair during styling without the need for teasing or backcombing. The Volumizer Crimper easily creates long-lasting volume at the roots, right where you need it most, adding texturised crimps to create a supportive structure. This prevents hair from falling flat. It's the new way to think about volume!! How To Use: For all over body, work your way from the bottom up towards the crown, crimping small sections of hair as close to the root as possible. Leave an inch of hair at the top of the head to style layers back over the texturised sections. Also ideal for adding extra height in the crown. Features: 16mm wide plates -- for closer to the scalp crimping 19mm ceramic barrel -- provides direct heat to hold styles for longer Multiple heat settings -- for all hair types and textures Cool tip -- safer handling Instant heat recovery -- maintains high heat for continuous styling 30-second fast heat up -- allows styling to start immediately Auto shut-off -- for added piece of mind Specifications
